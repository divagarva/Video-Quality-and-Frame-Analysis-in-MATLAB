# Video-Quality-and-Frame-Analysis-in-MATLAB
 This MATLAB project reads a video, processes a specified number of frames, performs analysis such as edge detection and histogram plotting, and saves the results in an output video. Each frame is displayed with its corresponding analysis, combining both the frame and plot into a single video output.
